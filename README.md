### PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project aims to help twitter users to know every thing in his twitter home page without reading all tweets.

KMeans clustering is used here to classify similar tweets together making the user able to read all topic with realy few tweets.


##### The project is splitted into three main parts:&nbsp;
###### 1.Data Collection :
###### Using tweepy library we'll load a set of tweets from a user twitter home page for a given date and time 
###### 2.Data Preprocessing :
###### The loaded data need to be processed before we pass it to the model, we'll clean tweets by removing urls,hashtags,emojis..
###### NLP will be a step further to preapre data for building the model. 
###### 3.Model Building :
###### Final step will be classifying tweets into clusters using KMEANS classifier from scratch.
